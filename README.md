These files are meant for use with the UW AAPS Hands-On R training sessions led by Mackenzie Bergagnini-Kolev and me (Laura Shireman). These files are also available from Dropbox, https://www.dropbox.com/sh/82701civol0x4r1/AADAZUtiC42btqEwehwIHjU1a?dl=0. 

In addition to these files, I've compiled a OneNote notebook over several years of working with R that has instructions for the training session as well as notes on all kinds of things you might want to do with R. Please email me and I'll share it with you. If you're reading this, you should have my email address. :-)
